This Project consists of two modules:
1. In the first module we try detecting the face and the eyes within the face from a live video camera.
2. In the second module we use a dataset from kaggle and using a pretrained model after fine tuning it with the help of pytorch we classified the data into two classes to classify open and close eyes.

Using the results of these two models calculated the number of eyeblinks in one minute in a live camera frame and if the user does not blink the eyes enough in a minute then a warning displays.

This project was built because maximum people do not blink enough infront of their laptops and mobile phones which can further result in dryness. (PS: I am not a doctor just an engineer tryng to make something creative.)
